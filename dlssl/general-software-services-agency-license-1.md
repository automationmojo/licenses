arrangement of terms.  For this *License*, specific consumers are offered a license to utilize the *Software* for free, if they
meet specific criteria and are willing to forego warranties of service.  Customers who do not qualify for the *Free* service or who

rights of Use under this agreement.

## 2. Preamble

The purpose of this *License* is to establish a general framework by which terms of service can be establish for the use of *"The Software"*.  Under this *License*, rights to Use *"The Software"* are issued based on a *Class of Service* model.  The *Class of Service* model allows a software *Provider* to make software solutions available on a trial basis and to specific qualifying entities for free while at the same time collecting fees from organizations wishing to use a software solution for commercial use.  The ability to register customers and to charge a subscription fee are a critical
component of funding software projects and ensuring thier ongoing maintenance and development.

This *License* offers two classes of services *Free Use* and *Paid Use*. *Customers* that intend to use *The Software* obtain rights to use this software by using an *"Order Form"* to establish a "Class of Service" agreement with *Provider*.  The combinded terms of this license and the "Order Form" work together to establish the full terms of the agreement between *Provider* and the *Customer*.  All *Customers* wishing to obtain the rights to Use *The Software* must complete the process of submitting an appropriate 'Order Form' through the Automation Mojo website.

    http://automationmojo.com/products

Properly obtaining the rights to use *The Software*, regardless of whether you qualify for the *"Free"* service class, is very important for the maintenance of the software and for keeping customers informed about upcoming changes to the software.   The information we gather from an "Order Form" about who our customers are, is invaluable to help ensure we provide the best service possible to all our customers.

*Provider* reserves the right to change the criteria used to determine what *Parties* are entitle to use the *Free Use* class of services.

The current criteria to quality for the *Free Use* class of service is as follows:

* Non-commercial and Non-Governmental entities
* Commercial entities with less than 10 people and that do not have more than 1 million in gross sales

All other entities must obtain a license under the "Paid Use" service class.  The free use service class does not include customer support services.  If you want customer support services, you will need to switch to the "Paid Use" service class license.
