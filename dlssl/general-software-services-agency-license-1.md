## 1. Common Definitions

As used herein, **"this License"** or **"the License"** refers to version 1 of the Automation Mojo - Dual License - Software Services
Agency License

*Agreement* means the combined terms laid out between the *Software Agency* and the *by *the License* and an "Order Form"

A "Dual License" is a software license that offers the use of software to different classes of consumers under two distinct
arrangement of terms.  For this *License*, specific consumers are offered a license to utilize the *Software* for free, if they
meet specific criteria and are willing to forego warranties of service, or for a subscription fee 

The terms "Provider", refer to a company or individual who is publishing *The Software* and potentially offering quality of service, maintenance, warrenties, and agency around the offered *The Software* and any associated services.

"Customer" refers to the individual, party or company that obtains a license to use "The Software" and "Services" offered by the *Provider".

"Order Form" refers to a document that explicitly defines the nature of the agreed upon *"Class of Service"* that is being agreed upon
between the *Services Agency* and the *Customer* with respect to the use of a *Software Products* offered by the *"Service Agency"*.

"Work Order" refers to a document that explicitly defines the nature of agreed upon terms of work for engineering work and services being offered between the *"Service Agency"* and the *"Customer"*. 

## 2. Preamble

The purpose of this license is to establish a general framework by which terms of service can be establish for the use of *"The Software"*.  Under this license, rights to Use *"The Software"* are issued based on a *Class of Service* model.  The *Class of Service* model allows a software services agency to make software solutions available on a trial basis and to specific qualifying entities for free while at the same time collecting fees from organizations wishing to use a software solution for commercial use to ensure return on investment and predictable funding of operations for the "Software Agency".

This license offers two classes of services *Free Use* and *Paid Use*. *Customers* that intend to use *The Software* obtain rights to use this software by using an *"Order Form"* to establish a "Class of Service" agreement with the *Provider".  The combinded terms of this license and the "Order Form" work together to establish the full terms of the agreement between the *Provider" and the *Customer*.  All *Customers* wishing to obtain the rights to Use *The Software* must complete the process of submitting an appropriate 'Order Form' through the Automation Mojo website.

    http://automationmojo.com/

Properly obtaining the rights to use *The Software*, regardless of whether you qualify for the *"Free"* service classe, is very important for the maintenance of the software.   The information we gather from an "Order Form" about who our customers are, is invaluable to help ensure we provide the best service possible to all our customers.

The *"Software Agency"* reserves the right to change the criteria used to determine what *Parties* are entitle to use the *Free Use* class of services.

The current criteria to quality for the *Free Use* class of service is as follows:

* Non-commercial and Non-Governmental entities
* Commercial entities with less than 10 people and that do not have more than 1 million in gross sales

All other entities must obtain a license under the "Paid Use" service class.  The free use service class does not include customer support services.  If you want customer support services, you will need to switch to the "Paid Use" service class license.

## 3. Common Terms 

### 3.1 "No Exclusivity".
This agreement is non-exclusive and, unless expressly stated otherwise in an *Order Form* or *Work Order* with respect to particular Software or Services.  Either party to this agreement may contract with other parties for the procurement or sale of similar Software and Services.

### 3.2 "Software Modifications".
This software is designed to be extended, customized and branded by *The Customer* for internal use.  This agreement does not allow the customization of this software for resale to another customer.  A *Third Party Services Agency* may extend or customize *"The Software"* for a *"Customer"* provided that *"The Customer"* obtains a license of *"The Software"* via the *"Software Agency"* appropriate *"Order Form"*.

### 3.3 "Use by Partners".
There may be occasions where *The Customer* wishes to offer *"The Software"* to partners as a tool for validating "The Customers" own products.  The use of "The Software" as a tool by partners must be authorized by the terms of an *Order Form* or by each partner obtaining a license to use *The Software* by completing an "Order Form". The terms of *This Agreement* do not allow the use of *"The Software"* by partners..   

### 3.4 "Use for Third Parties".
Customer may purchase from "The Service Agency" the rights to Use the Software for third parties with the scope of any such rights set forth by the class of service associated with an Order Form.

### 3.5 "Delivery".
*"The Software"* is made available on an ongoing basis via the use of an online software repository.  This means the *"Customer"* is entitled to obtain copies of *"The Software"* at any time.  The *Provider" is not responsible for any work stopages or outages due to any repository downtime.   In situations where immediate on-demand delivery of *"The Software"* is a part of *"The Customers"* internal operations and processes, it is recommended that the *"The Customer"* utilize an internal package management system that caches an copy of the different version of *"The Software"*.

### 3.6 "Updates"
Customer acknowledges that the Software may evolve over time and "The Services Agency" retains the right to modify, update, and/or upgrade the Software during the License term ("Update").  In the event of such an Update, Customer's payment obligations will remain unchanged for the duration of the then existing Subscription Term.  Other than Updates, the Provider may release features or modules to which additional Fees may apply. If such an Update would have a material adverse effect on the operation of the Software or the compatibility with Customer’s business or regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, hardware, software or browser configurations, then Customer may, in its sole discretion, reject such Updates. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to each major Update or change, Provider may, on terms to be agreed, provide such Services as requested by Customer to assist in any installation and integration of the Update.

### 3.7 "Monitoring"

Provider may monitor Customer’s compliance with Usage Limitations using Provider’s own resources such as server logs and similar records or usage data provided from the Software to Provider. If Provider cannot determine Customer’s
compliance with a Usage Limitation solely with reference to Provider’s own resources, Provider may request in writing no more than once every twelve (12) months that Customer provide a report to Provider concerning Customer’s compliance with the Usage Limitation. Customer shall provide such report to Provider within a reasonable time after receiving the request (not to exceed sixty (60) days), and such report will include a listing of versions of the Software in use by Customer as well as the specific Customer components within which the Software is Used. The reports will be issued by knowledgeable personnel of Customer. The obligation to provide the foregoing reports shall survive any termination of this Agreement for so long as Customer continues to Use the Software.

### 3.8 "Exceeding Usage Limitations"
If Customer exceeds a Usage Limitation, then no more than once every twelve (12) months, Provider may provide to Customer a written notice which states what the Usage Limitation is, the amount by which Customer is exceeding the Usage Limitation, how the exceedance was measured, and the amount of additional Fees that Customer will be required to pay through the end of the Order Form Term at the rate stated in the Order Form with respect to the Usage Limitation (the “Exceedance Notice”).
